== Hystrix Command with Service Activator

This sample demonstrate how we can apply a Spring Cloud `@HystrixCommand` on the Spring Integration `@ServiceActivator`.

NOTE: Since Netflix Hystrix proxying is based on the AspectJ, we can't apply `@HystrixCommand` on the `@MessagingGateway` interfaces.
The JDK Proxy is not compatible with AspectJ and method annotations are not visible for the `AspectJAwareAdvisorAutoProxyCreator`.
